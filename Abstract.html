<h1>Parking , Cruising, and Congestion (Job Market Paper)</h1>

<p><b>Abstract</b> This paper uses a novel block-by-block panel data set of garages, traffic speed, meters, and free-of-charge curbside parking to map and assess the effects of on-street parking on traffic in New York City. The analysis starts with a theoretical model that rationalizes the connection between parking prices and traffic. The model shows how expensive garages and cheap curbside parking increase traffic volume because drivers that park curbside must cruise in search of parking. Based on the theoretical model, I follow a difference-in-differences approach to measure the effects of on-street parking on traffic speed. Estimates of the model show a significant speed reduction when free on-street parking is allowed. I further exploit variation in the data over time and space to analyze how low curbside rates induce drivers to park on the street and how pricing behavior differs between garage operators and city officials. The data show that most drivers have a significant incentive to cruise in search of on-street parking, especially in congested locations like Manhattan below 96th street.</p>
